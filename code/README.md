## Introduction
The code is Pytorch-based.

## Todo
We will gradually include state-of-the-art algorithms (with training data&code) for each chapter as well as optimise exisiting algorithms.

## Acknowledgement
Our target here is to collect&verifiy&optimise reproducible state-of-the-art methods for each face topic.
Thanks for the open-source code from authors and reproducers.

## Reference
Please cite the original papers of these classic face analysis algorithms.
